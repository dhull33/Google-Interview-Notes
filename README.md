# Google Interview Notes

Welcome friends! Here you will find notes and python code for an 
upcoming interview with Google. Every software engineer has heard how 
difficult Google's interview process is and I thought that maybe I could help
 make the process a little easier for other engineers. This is also a great 
 place if all you want to do is learn data structures or find out how to 
 reverse a string in python or other random things. 
 
Let me know if you have any questions!

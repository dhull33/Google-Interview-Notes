# Interview Notes

Welcome friends! Here you will find notes and python code for an 
upcoming interview. Every software engineer knows the interview process is difficult and I thought that maybe I could help
make the process a little easier for other engineers. This is also a great place if all you want to do is learn data structures or find out how to reverse a string in python or other random things. 
 
Let me know if you have any questions!
